# gamejamtemplate
This is a game jam template used by Moonlit Cafe for their general games. This can be thought of as the precursor to
the game-genre specific templates that will come later.

## Commonly Added Addons
- ToDo: Used for noting the code for fixes and tasks that need to be done (y'know like a ToDo is supposed to do)
- LimboAI: Our favorite BehaviorTree/StateMachine addon
